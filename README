Speed-up the development of Lua scripts:
- insert code snippets: comments, statements, functions, regular expressions, ...
- ... which come in an extendible template library
- quickly comment the code by automatically generating function descriptions
- run or compile the code from within Vim
- run the syntax checker
- quick access to the online documentation

The screen shots of the original lua-support give an impression : http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-lua/ 

While this plug-in is conceived as a successor of the original lua-support ( http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1763 ), backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
However, we hope that the better configurability through the template library and other new features make for a product which is much better suited to deal with a language like Lua.
